# Planned Features


## Gameplay rendering

* Other spinner textures (currently only the spinner approach circle is rendered)
* Note lock indicator (probably just a shake animation like in osu!)
* Improve performance
* Option to disable hit circle explosion animation

## Gameplay audio

* Hit sounds and other effect sounds (such as combo breaking)
* Fix audio off sync issue somehow

## Analysis tools

* Key hit overlay + note sheet combined
* Edge hits detection
* Heat map (maybe using heatmap.js)

## Gameplay simulation

This refers to the very fast heuristic algorithm that allows simulating the game play (even longer ones) within a second:

* Setup test automation
* Spinner simulation (currently it's always judged as 300 regardless you missed or not)
* Fix double tap bug
* Fix certain edge cases

Lower priority:
* ScoreV2 support
* pp-related stuff

## Others

* Jumping to next "combo break" (miss / slider break) event as a shortcut or similar
* Full screen
