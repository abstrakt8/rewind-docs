# Installation

## Windows

First download the .exe file from the [release page](https://github.com/abstrakt8/rewind/releases/latest) e.g. "Rewind-Setup-0.1.0.exe"

Windows might show you some security warnings about the execution file since it is not verified with a code certificate (they cost hundreds of dollars). Just click on "More Info" -> "Run anyway" to run the installation.

If for some reason the installation fails, try running the executable as admin.

## Linux

### AUR package (Arch, Manjaro, ...)

There is an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rewind-bin/) maintained by [Malteser](https://github.com/aMalteser).

You can use an AUR helper (e.g. `yay`) to ease the installation process.

### General

First download the [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) file e.g. "Rewind-0.1.0.AppImage" from the [release page](https://github.com/abstrakt8/rewind/releases/tag/latest)

Then you need to give the file execution permissions:

```
chmod u+x Rewind-0.1.0.AppImage
```

You can then start it with:

```
./Rewind-0.1.0.AppImage
```

## macOS

Not officially supported. Maybe in the future.
